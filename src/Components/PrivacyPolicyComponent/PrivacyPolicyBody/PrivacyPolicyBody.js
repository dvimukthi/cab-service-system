      <h1>USER PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>

      <p>
        GoCheeta(Lanka) Private Limited collects information about you when you
        use our GoCheeta User App, websites, and other online products and
        services (collectively, the “Services”) and through other interactions
        and communications you have with us. This Privacy Statement applies to
        information collected and used by GoCheeta.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope and Application</h3>

      <p>
        This Privacy Statement (“Statement") applies to all persons who use the
        GoCheeta User App or Services to request transportation, delivery, or
        other on-demand services (“Users”). It does not apply to information we
        collect from or about service providers who use the GoCheeta platform
        under license (collectively “Mobility Service Providers”). If you
        interact with the Services as both, User and a Mobility Service
        Provider, the respective privacy statements will apply to your different
        interactions.
      </p>

      <h3>Collection of Information</h3>

      <p>Information You Provide to Us</p>
      <p>
        We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you
        create or modify your account, request on-demand services, contact
        customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may
        include: name, email, phone number, postal address, profile picture,
        payment method, orders requested (for delivery services), delivery
        notes, and other information you choose to provide.
      </p>
      <p>Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services.</p>
      <p>
        When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the
        following general categories:
      </p>
      <p>
        Location Information: When you use the Services for transportation or
        delivery, we collect precise location data about the trip from the
        GoCheeta App used by the Mobility Service Provider. If you permit the
        GoCheeta App to access location services through the permission system
        used by your mobile operating system “Platform”, we may also collect
        the precise location of your device when the App is running in the
        foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location
        from your IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contacts Information: If you permit the GoCheeta User App to access the
        address book on your device through the permission system used by your
        mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information
        from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our
        Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the
        time of consent or collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transaction Information: We collect transaction details related to your
        use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and
        time the service was provided, amount charged, distance travelled, and
        other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your
        promo code, we may associate your name with that person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you
        and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and
        settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies,
        pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique
        identifiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Device Information: We may collect information about your mobile device,
        including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and
        version, software and file names and versions, preferred language,
        unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device
        motion information, and mobile network information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Call and SMS Data: Our Services facilitate communications between Users
        and Mobility Services Providers. In connection with facilitating this
        service, we receive call data, including the date and time of the call
        or SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of the SMS
        message.
      </p>
      <p>
        Log Information: When you interact with the Services, we collect server
        logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates
        and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system
        activity, type of browser, and the third party site or service you were
        using before interacting with our Services.
      </p>

      <h3>Important Information About Platform Permissions</h3>

      <p>
        Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of
        device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these
        platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent.
        The iOS platform will alert you the first time the GoCheeta app wants
        permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or
        not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the
        permissions that the GoCheeta app seeks before you first use the app,
        and your use of the app constitutes your consent. Sometimes these
        permissions require more explanation than the platforms themselves
        provide, and the permissions we request will change over time.
      </p>

      <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OTHER SOURCES</h2>

      <p>
        We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with
        information we collect through our Services. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to link, create, or log in to your GoCheeta account with a
        payment provider (eg: Google Wallet) or social media service (e.g.,
        Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our
        API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your
        connections from that site or app.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your employer uses one of our enterprise solutions, such as GoCheeta
        services, we may receive information about you from your employer.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you request on demand services, Mobility Service Providers on our
        platform may provide us with a User rating after providing services to
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance
        as a Mobility Service Providers or user of other apps we provide, we may
        combine or associate that information with information we have collected
        from you in your capacity as a User or a Mobility Service Provider.
      </p>

      <h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>

      <p>We may use the information we collect about you to:</p>

        request (and send related information), develop new features, provide
        customer support to Users and Mobility Service Providers, develop safety
        features, authenticate users, and send product updates and
        administrative messages;

      </p>

        Send or facilitate communications (i) between you and a Mobility Service
        Provider, such as estimated times of arrival (ETAs), or (ii) between you
        and a contact of yours at your direction in connection with your use of
        certain features, such as referrals, invites, split fare requests, or
        ETA sharing; Send you communications we think will be of interest to
        you, including information about products, services, promotions, news,

      </p>
      <p>

        features, content, social connections, referrals, and advertisements. We
        may transfer the information described in this Statement to, and process
        and store it in, Sri Lanka and other countries, some of which may have
        less protective data protection laws than the region in which you
        reside. Where this is the case, we will take reasonable measures to
        protect your personal information in accordance with this Statement.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        We may allow others to provide audience measurement and analytics
        services for us, to serve advertisements on our behalf across the
        Internet, and to track and report on the performance of those
        advertisements. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, and
        other technologies to identify your device when you visit our site and
        use our Services, as well as when you visit other online sites and
        services.
      </p>

      <h3>Account Information</h3>

      <p>
        You may correct your account information at any time by logging into
        your online or in-app account. If you wish to cancel your account,
        please email us at support@gocheeta.lk. Please note that in some cases
        we may retain certain information about you as required by law, or for
        legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law. For
        instance, if you have a standing credit or debt on your account, or if
        we believe you have committed fraud or violated our Terms, we may seek
        to resolve the issue before deleting your information.
      </p>

      <h3>Access Rights</h3>

      <p>
        GoCheeta will comply with individual’s requests regarding access,
        correction, and/or deletion of the personal data it stores in accordance
        with applicable law.
      </p>

      <h3>Location Information</h3>

      <p>
        We request permission for our app’s collection of precise location from
        your device per the permission system used by your mobile operating
        system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, you
        can later disable it by changing the location settings on your mobile
        device. However, this will limit your ability to use certain features of
        our Services.
      </p>

      <h2>CONTACT INFORMATION</h2>

      <p>
        We may also seek permission for our app’s collection and syncing of
        contact information from your device per the permission system used by
        your mobile operating system. If you initially permit the collection of
        this information, iOS users can later disable it by changing the
        contacts settings on your mobile device. The Android platform does not
        provide such a setting.
      </p>

      <h3>Promotional Communications</h3>

      <p>
        You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us by following
        the instructions in those messages. If you opt out, we may still send
        you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account,
        about Services you have requested, or our ongoing business relations.
      </p>

      <h3>How we use cookies</h3>

      <p>
        A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your
        computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie
        helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular
        site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual.
        The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and
        dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your
        preferences. We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are
        being used. This helps us analyse data about webpage traffic and improve
        our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this
        information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is
        removed from the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling
        us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie
        in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you,
        other than the data you choose to share with us. You can choose to
        accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept
        cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline
        cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage
        of the website.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to the Statement</h3>

      <p>
        We may change this Statement from time to time. If we make significant
        changes in the way we treat your personal information, or to the
        Statement, we will provide you notice through the Services or by some
        other means, such as email. Your continued use of the Services after
        such notice constitutes your consent to the changes. We encourage you to
        periodically review the Statement for the latest information on our
        privacy practices.
